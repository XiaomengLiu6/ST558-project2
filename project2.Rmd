# overall goal\

Our goal with this project is to create a vignette about contacting an API using functions you’ve created to
query, parse, and return well-structured data. You’ll then use your functions to obtain data from the API and
do some exploratory data analysis. This is an individual project and your work will be done in a github repo.
